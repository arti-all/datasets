# datasets
Files uploaded in this repository belong to various research papers.

1. CryptoMine (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3382494.3422166)
In this dataset, we analyzed hundreds open-source Java applications in which JCA APIs were used. We also manually assessed nearly half of the dataset.
2. HackerOne (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03859)
We analyzed crypto-related vulnerabilities found and reported by security experts to HackerOne. The dataset contains vulnerabilities of all kinds and it is not restricted to only crypto-related reports.
3. JCA_survey (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9680282)
The files contains the responses of 97 developers who had used JCA APIs in their projects. 
4. large_scale_analysis (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07141)
We analysed nearly all of the crypto-related questions on Stack Overflow. The folder includes the posts, pyLDA chart, tags per topics, and initial tags.
5. mapping_data (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9680277)
The folder includes top-rated users in cryptography and the initial tags for finding crypto-related topics
